# electronic-circuit-that-connects-distance-sensor-with-two-Arduinos
In this task, I designed and programmed an electronic circuit that connects the distance sensor with the first Arduino (controller) and with the second Arduino instead of the Bluetooth model, because there is no Bluetooth model in Tinkercad, where when a person is in front of the sensor for three seconds, the LED light will turn on instead of the screen.

### The circuit design 
The circuit contains:

- Arduino UNO.
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor HC-SR04
- 6 servo motors.
- 4.5V Battery.
- Wires ( red= power , black= ground , yellow =trig , green = echo , blue and gray = conect Ard1 to Ard2).
 
and the circuit was designed using tinkercad website as below:
